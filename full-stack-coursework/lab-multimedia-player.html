Title: What is the map method and how does it work

00:00:00 Speaker 1
What is the map method and how does it work?  

00:00:03 Speaker 1
The map method is a powerful and widely used function in JavaScript that operates on arrays. 
 

00:00:11 Speaker 1
It is designed to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original 
array.  

00:00:19 Speaker 1
This method does not modify the original array, but instead returns a new array containing 
the results of the function applied to each element.  

00:00:29 Speaker 1
Here's an example of using the map method on an array of numbers.  

00:00:34 Speaker 1
To create a new array where each number is doubled, we are using the map method.  

00:00:38 Speaker 1
The map method accepts a callback function where the function is called on every single element 
in the array.  

00:00:47 Speaker 1
In this case, each number in the array will be multiplied by two.  

00:00:51 Speaker 1
The result will be a new array of the numbers two, four, six, eight, 10.  

00:00:56 Speaker 1
The callback function can accept up to three arguments.</p>
