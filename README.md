# Akunor's freeCodeCamp Repository

This repository contains all coursework projects, daily challenges, and other code produced while working through [freeCodeCamp.org's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) comprehensive programming courses - primarily their certified [Full-Stack developer program](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer).

## Repo Structure

### Full-Stack Coursework
Contains HTML projects and exercises from freeCodeCamp's full-stack development curriculum:
- **Web Design Projects**: Recipe pages, travel agency sites, video compilation pages, and more
- **Interactive Elements**: Multimedia players, checkout pages, catalog tables and more
- **Responsive Design**: Movie review pages, modern web layouts and more

### Daily Challenges
A collection of daily programming challenges and coding exercises to maintain consistent practice and skill development, particularly in Python.

## Learning Goals
- Master full-stack web development skills
- Build responsive, accessible web applications
- Develop problem-solving skills through daily coding challenges
- Create a portfolio of diverse web projects
- Reinforce Python learning from other projects

## Getting Started
Each project is self-contained and can be opened directly in a web browser. More advanced projects across the course will be contained within their own folders with separate files for JavaScript, CSS, HTML and more.
